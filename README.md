# Parcel in Drupal 9

This is small example of a simple approach when wanting to utilize Parcel in Drupal.
Parcel v2 is still in beta and might not be suitable for production quite yet.
That said we do use it in production and have discovered no immediate problems.

## Getting up and running

### Install Drupal
Get the Drupal site up and running.
This can be done using [Task](https://taskfile.dev/#/) and [Lando](https://lando.dev).

```
task up
```

### Destroy

```
task reset
```
